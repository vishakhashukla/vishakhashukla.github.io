I am a second year PhD student in the 
<a href="https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/departments/communicative-sciences-and-disorders">Department of Communicative Sciences and Disorders</a>, New York University.

I am interested in language development in autistic and nonspectrum children, particularly in the context of parent-child interactions. My current research focus is on online comprehension of parent narratives by autistic children. Prior to this, I was part of a project led by <a href = "https://www.hf.uio.no/ifikk/personer/vit/filosofi/midlertidig/paulorf/index.html"> Dr. Paula Rubio Fernandez</a> that investigated referential communication in newly sighted and blind children.
