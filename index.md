I am a third year PhD student in the 
<a href="https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/departments/communicative-sciences-and-disorders">Department of Communicative Sciences and Disorders</a>, New York University. I work with <a href="https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/sudha-arunachalam">Dr. Sudha Arunachalam</a> as a member of <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/learnlab/">LEARN Lab</a>. My current research interests are language development in autistic and non-autistic children, parent-child interactions, and crossneurotpye interactions in adults.

As a neurodivergent person, I am passionate about learning and spreading awareness about neurodiversity-informed research. I run a **N**euro**D**iversity **R**eading **G**roup in my department and record some of my thoughts in this sporadically updated <a href = "/ndrg-blog/">blog</a>.
