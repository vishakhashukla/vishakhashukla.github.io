Hi! I am a first year PhD student in the 
<a href="https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/departments/communicative-sciences-and-disorders">Department of Communicative Sciences and Disorders</a>, New York University. I work with <a href="https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/sudha-arunachalam">Dr. Sudha Arunachalam</a> as part of <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/learnlab/">LEARN Lab</a>. <br>

I am broadlly interested in language development with special focus on child-caregiver interactions. My current research focus is on online comprehension of parent narratives by autistic children. 
I have a developing interest in neurodiversity studies and like getting to know other neurodivergent academics. You can reach me at <a href= "mailto:vshukla@nyu.edu"> vshukla@nyu.edu </a> if you would like to connect.
