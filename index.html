Hi! I am a first year PhD student in the 
<a href="https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/departments/communicative-sciences-and-disorders">Department of Communicative Sciences and Disorders</a>, New York University. I work with <a href="https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/sudha-arunachalam">Dr. Sudha Arunachalam</a> as part a of <a href="https://wp.nyu.edu/learnlab/">LEARN Lab</a>. <br>
<br>
I am primarily interested in how caregiver-child interactions support pragmatic development. Since narratives provide an excellent tool to probe pragmatic skills, in two of my <a href= "https://vishakhashukla.github.io/Research/">ongoing projects</a> I am using narratives to study language development in typically developing and autistic children. <br>
